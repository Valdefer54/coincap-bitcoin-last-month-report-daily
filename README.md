# CoinCap Bitcoin Last Month Report Daily

This project automates the retrieval of Bitcoin's daily historical data from the CoinCap API. It processes the data to focus on the last 30 days (approximately) and exports the result to a CSV file.

## Features

- **Fetches Data**: Connects to the CoinCap API to retrieve Bitcoin daily history (`d1` interval).
- **Data Filtering**: Filters the dataset to retain only the most recent ~30 days of data.
- **Date Handling**: Automatically assigns calendar dates to the data points, ending with "yesterday" (relative to the execution date).
- **Export**: Saves the processed data to `bitcoin_last_month.csv`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- An API Key from [CoinCap](https://coincap.io/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd coincap-bitcoin-last-month-report-daily
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas python-dotenv
   ```

3. Configure your API Key:
   - Create a file named `.env` in the root directory.
   - Add your CoinCap API key:
     ```env
     COINCAP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

## Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Upon successful execution, a file named `bitcoin_last_month.csv` will be created (or overwritten) in the project directory, containing the data columns (e.g., priceUsd, time, etc.) along with the calculated `Date` column.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that fetches, cleans, and saves the data.
- `.env`: Configuration file for environment variables (not included in repo, must be created).
- `bitcoin_last_month.csv`: Output file generated by the script.
